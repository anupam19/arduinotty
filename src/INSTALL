# "Arduino TTY" - A serial terminal for the Arduino platform.

INSTALL:

1. Compiling and Installation in Linux:

1.1. Install dependencies:

     You need "mono", "pango-sharp" and "gtk-sharp-2.0" to
     run "Arduino TTY" and "nant" to compile it.
     
     Ubuntu Oneric Ocelot: 
     
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install mono-runtime notify-sharp gtk-sharp2 nant

1.2. Compile and install "Arduino TTY":

    Open the bash-terminal and change the current-directory to 
    the directory where this files lies.
    To compile and install type in the following commands:
 
    Generic linux:

    1. nant -buildfile:build-files/linux.build
    2. sudo nant -buildfile:build-files/linux.build install

    To uninstall this application type:
    sudo nant -buildfile:build-files/linux.build uninstall

    Ubuntu Oneric Ocelot:

    1. nant -buildfile:build-files/ubuntu11.10.build
    2. sudo nant -buildfile:build-files/ubuntu11.10.build install

    To uninstall this application type:
    sudo nant -buildfile:build-files/ubuntu11.10.build uninstall

1.3. Compiling problems

    Maybe, you encountered a message like this, at the command
    "nant -buildfile:build-files/linux.build".

    The type or namespace name `Gtk' could not be found in the global
    namespace (are you missing an assembly reference?)

    The problem is, that pkg-config can't find one or more needed libraries, 
    So you have to adapt the file "linux.build" in the directory "build-files".

    Open the file "linux.build" with a text-editor and look for these two blocks:

    1. Block:

    <references>
      <include name="../bin/libarduinotty.dll"/>
      <include name="gdk-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="glib-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="gtk-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="Mono.Posix.dll"/>
      <include name="System.dll"/>
      <include name="System.Xml.dll"/>
      <include name="pango-sharp.dll"/>
    </references>

    2. Block

    <references>
      <include name="gdk-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="glib-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="gtk-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="Mono.Posix.dll"/>
      <include name="System.dll"/>
      <include name="System.Xml.dll"/>
      <include name="pango-sharp.dll"/>
    </references>

    You have to declare the full path of every listed library, 
    except for the library "libarduinotty.dll".
    Use "locate" to find out the full paths of these libraries.

    Example:
    locate gtk-sharp.dll

    For Ubuntu 11.10 the blocks would look like this:

    1. Block
    
    <references>
      <include name="../bin/libarduinotty.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/cli/gdk-sharp-2.0/gdk-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/cli/glib-sharp-2.0/glib-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/cli/gtk-sharp-2.0/gtk-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/mono/2.0/Mono.Posix.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/mono/4.0/System.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/mono/4.0/System.Xml.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/cli/pango-sharp-2.0/pango-sharp.dll"/>
    </references>

    2. Block

    <references>
      <include name="/usr/lib/cli/gdk-sharp-2.0/gdk-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/cli/glib-sharp-2.0/glib-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/cli/gtk-sharp-2.0/gtk-sharp.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/mono/2.0/Mono.Posix.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/mono/4.0/System.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/mono/4.0/System.Xml.dll"/>
      <include name="/usr/lib/cli/pango-sharp-2.0/pango-sharp.dll"/>
    </references>

    When you're ready, save this file.

    Now you can execute the command "nant -buildfile:build-files/linux.build" to compile 
    "Arduino TTY v0.1" and "nant -buildfile:build-files/linux.build install" to install it.

    Please send me your your "linux.build" with the information, 
    which linux system you're using, via E-Mail to me.
    
    E-mail: arduinotty@gmail.com

    This would be nice, because I can add these files into the next release of "Arduino TTY".
